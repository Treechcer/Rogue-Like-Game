# Rogue-Like-Game
A simple roguelike game built with Python and Pygame. Navigate your character through a dynamically loaded tile-based map, avoiding walls and interacting with moving enemies. This project is a learning exercise in game development and classic roguelike mechanics.

## Features
- **Tile-based movement**: Control your character using the arrow keys.

- **Enemy AI**: Enemies move strategically toward the player.

- **Dynamic level loading**: Levels are drawn dynamically from a 2D array.

- **Custom sprites**: Predefined sprite assets bring the game to life.

- **Fullscreen gameplay**: The game automatically adjusts to fullscreen, scaling to fit any resolution.

- Python 3.8+

- Pygame 2.0+
